I have done some research into given [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16LkwOXX8XxDV45VgXaDXAQNJASUF71bS) and decided to focus on an Email Classification dataset because I became more enthusiastic about Natural Language Processing.
## Libraries I am going to use ##
- Gradio
  The library is simple to understand and to start with if you need to create a simple interface for your solution.
- spaCy
  Modern NLP library, which supports around 70 languages and has pipelines for 25+ languages. As for now, I think I will use spaCy as a main NLP library in the project because it has built-in   lemmatization and is more convenient for smaller projects.
- scikit-learn
  It contains plenty of metrics and models, which might be used in the project (TfIdfClassifier, confusion_matrix, classification_report).
- NLTK

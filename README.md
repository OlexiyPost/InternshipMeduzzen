I have done some research into given [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16LkwOXX8XxDV45VgXaDXAQNJASUF71bS) and decided to focus on an Email Classification dataset because I became more enthusiastic about Natural Language Processing.
## Libraries I am going to use ##
- **Gradio**<br/>
  The library is simple to understand and to start with if you need to create a simple interface for your solution.
- **spaCy**<br/>
  Modern NLP library, which supports around 70 languages and has pipelines for 25+ languages. As for now, I think I will use spaCy as a main NLP library in the project because it has built-in   lemmatization and is more convenient for smaller projects.
- **scikit-learn**<br/>
  It contains plenty of metrics and models, which might be used in the project (*TfIdfClassifier, confusion_matrix, classification_report*).
- **NLTK**<br/>
  This library might be useful, as it is more flexible than spaCy and gives more control of NLP pipeline.
- **Pandas**<br/>
  This library is useful for data structurization. For instance, I could structurize emails by *Rolle* mentioned in *ROLLEN_VORGANG* spreadsheet from Email Classification dataset.
- **TensorFlow Keras**
  TensorFlow offers a rich selection of pre-trained models for NLP, such as BERT, GPT or Word2Vec, which might be useful.

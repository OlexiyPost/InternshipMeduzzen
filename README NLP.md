Here is my opinion on Natural Language Processing challenge.
## Libraries I am going to use ##
- **Gradio**<br/>
  This library is convenient to 
- **spaCy**<br/>
  Modern NLP library, which supports around 70 languages and has pipelines for 25+ languages. As for now, I think I will use spaCy as a main NLP library in the project because it has built-in lemmatization and is more convenient for   
  smaller projects.
- **NLTK**<br/>
  This library might be useful, as it is more flexible than spaCy and gives more control of NLP pipeline.
- **Pandas**<br/>
  This library is useful for data structurization. I could structurize previous inputs and outputs to show as an example for users.
- **TensorFlow Keras**<br/>
  TensorFlow offers a wide variety of pre-trained models for NLP, such as BERT, GPT or Word2Vec, which might be useful.

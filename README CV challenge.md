I looked into Nova Poshta dataset and I believe I would need to do the following:
1. **Classify the images, make a train-test split.**
2. **Train the model**
3. **Make predictions & reports**
## Libraries I would use ##
- NumPy
- TensorFlow Keras
- OpenCV
- Pandas
I will add more steps and libraries as I get more requirements for this challenge.
